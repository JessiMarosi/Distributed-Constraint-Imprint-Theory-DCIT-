# Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory (DCIT)

## I. Status

This document is the authoritative canon of Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory (DCIT).

It defines the theory only.

It does not describe implementation.
It does not describe tooling.
It does not prescribe operational workflows.

Any system claiming compliance must conform to this canon.

## II. Formal Definition

**Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory (DCIT)** is a forensic reconstruction theory which holds:

> High-impact digital actions impose measurable constraints across distributed technical systems.  
> These constraints leave persistent imprints that permit bounded post-event reconstruction without interpreting identity, intent, expressive content, or behavior.

DCIT concerns necessary system-state conditions only.

---

## III. Domain and Scope

DCIT applies exclusively to:

- Post-event digital reconstruction
- Lawfully obtained artifact sets
- Distributed technical systems

DCIT does not apply to:

- Real-time monitoring
- Predictive modeling
- Behavioral classification
- Identity attribution
- Intent inference
- Content or speech interpretation

If any of the above are introduced, the system is not DCIT-compliant.

## IV. Core Axioms

### Axiom 1  Distributed Persistence

Digital actions leave residual artifacts that persist unevenly across independent systems.

### Axiom 2  Asynchronous Divergence

Records diverge across systems in time, state, and ordering.  
Divergence is measurable and may itself function as a constraint variable.

### Axiom 3  Operational Load Imprint

High-impact actions impose measurable strain disproportionate to routine use.

### Axiom 4  Path Constraint

Once a state transition sequence begins, future states become constrained, including under attempted reversal or erasure.

### Axiom 5  Environmental Coupling

Digital actions couple to infrastructure beyond the actors control, generating independent artifacts.

---

## V. Epistemic Boundary

DCIT recognizes only three output states:

- Necessary  
- Impossible  
- Undetermined  

DCIT does not produce:

- Probabilistic rankings
- Behavioral descriptions
- Narrative conclusions
- Identity claims
- Guilt assessments
- Intent analysis

DCIT produces system-state constraint statements only.

---

## VI. Evidence Model

Permitted inputs:

- Logs
- Metadata
- Timestamps
- Resource metrics
- Synchronization records
- State transition artifacts

Prohibited inputs:

- Expressive message content
- Communication bodies
- Speech transcripts
- Semantic interpretation

DCIT inspects systems, not speech.

---

## VII. Necessary-Condition Doctrine

All DCIT claims must be framed as necessary-condition statements.

Example (abstract form):

> For constraint set C to exist, action class A must have occurred within bounded parameters.

DCIT does not assert likelihood.
It does not assert attribution.
It asserts constraint compatibility only.

---

## VIII. Failure Conditions

DCIT is invalidated if:

1. Necessary-condition claims are reproducibly contradicted by consistent artifact sets.
2. Deterministic reconstruction cannot be replicated under identical inputs.
3. Expressive content is required to derive constraint primitives.
4. Identity, intent, or behavioral inference enters the model.
5. The system expands into live or continuous observation.

If these occur, the model ceases to be DCIT.

## IX. Clarifications in Response to Common Objections

### Objection: Is this merely timeline reconstruction?

DCIT does not claim novelty in timeline aggregation.  
Its contribution is epistemic restriction to necessary-condition reasoning and formal boundary enforcement.

### Objection: Why exclude probability?

Probabilistic reasoning increases overclaim risk and weakens adversarial defensibility.  
DCIT prioritizes bounded certainty over speculative completeness.

### Objection: Without attribution, how is it useful?

DCIT is a reconstruction theory, not an attribution theory.  
Attribution may be addressed separately in legal or investigative processes.

### Objection: Is this overly restrictive?

The restriction is intentional.  
Constraint-bounded scope increases reproducibility and reduces misuse vectors.

---

## X. TheoryInstrument Separation

DCIT is the theory layer.

Implementation instruments must enforce:

- Post-event closure
- Case isolation
- Expressive-content prohibition
- Necessary-condition-only reasoning

If implementation expands beyond these limits, it is not DCIT-compliant.

## XI. Canonical Status

This document constitutes the authoritative statement of Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory.

Future modifications require explicit versioning and justification.
