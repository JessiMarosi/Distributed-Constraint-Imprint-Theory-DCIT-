# DCIT Structural Laws

## I. Purpose

This document defines the structural commitments that preserve the integrity of Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory (DCIT).

These laws are enforcement-level constraints.

Violation of any law invalidates DCIT compliance.

This document does not redefine the theory.  
It defines structural conditions required to preserve it.

## II. Post-Event Closure Law

DCIT operates exclusively on closed artifact sets.

A closed artifact set is one in which no further artifacts are being generated by the originating systems under analysis.

Continuous ingestion, streaming telemetry, or live observation violates this law.

---

## III. Case Isolation Law

Each reconstruction must be epistemically isolated.

No cross-case aggregation is permitted.

No behavioral baselining across individuals or entities is permitted.

No adaptive learning derived from prior cases is permitted.

Each case stands alone.

---

## IV. Non-Expressive Boundary Law

DCIT-compliant systems must not process expressive or semantic content.

Schema structures must not contain fields capable of holding:

- Message bodies
- Communication content
- Speech transcripts
- Semantic interpretations

If expressive processing becomes technically possible, compliance fails.

---

## V. Necessary-Condition Enforcement Law

All outputs must conform to necessary-condition reasoning.

Outputs must be limited to:

- Necessary
- Impossible
- Undetermined

Probabilistic rankings, likelihood statements, or confidence scoring are prohibited.

---

## VI. Non-Accusatory Output Law

DCIT outputs must describe system-state transitions only.

Outputs must not:

- Attribute actions to individuals
- Assert intent
- Assert motive
- Describe behavior

Actor claims are outside the scope of DCIT.

---

## VII. No Narrative Generation Law

DCIT systems must not generate narrative event stories.

Permissible outputs include:

- Constraint graphs
- Feasibility windows
- Exclusion zones
- Minimal action requirement statements

Human-authored narrative interpretation may occur externally but is not part of DCIT.

---

## VIII. Divergence Recognition Principle

Asynchronous divergence across distributed systems is a measurable variable, not an error condition.

Systems must treat divergence as a potential constraint input rather than automatically reconciling it as noise.

---

## IX. Anti-Drift Enforcement Clause

Any implementation claiming DCIT compliance must structurally enforce:

- Post-event closure
- Case isolation
- Non-expressive processing
- Necessary-condition-only outputs

If an implementation introduces:

- Monitoring functionality
- Behavioral analytics
- Risk scoring
- Predictive modeling
- Identity binding

It ceases to be DCIT-compliant.

---

## X. Structural Status

These laws are binding for all DCIT-compliant implementations.

They may not be relaxed without redefining the theory itself.
