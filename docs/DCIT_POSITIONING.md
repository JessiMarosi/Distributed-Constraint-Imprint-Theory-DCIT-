# DCIT Positioning Guidance

## I. Purpose

This document defines approved and prohibited framing for Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory (DCIT).

It exists to prevent messaging drift and preserve doctrinal clarity across academic, governmental, enterprise, and public contexts.

---

## II. Approved Descriptions

DCIT MAY be described as:

- A forensic reconstruction theory
- A constraint-based post-event reconstruction framework
- A deterministic system-state reconstruction model
- A governance-restrained reconstruction doctrine

DCIT SHOULD be framed as:

- Post-event only
- Artifact-based
- Necessary-condition oriented
- Non-probabilistic
- Non-accusatory

---

## III. Prohibited Descriptions

DCIT MUST NOT be described as:

- A surveillance tool
- A monitoring system
- A detection engine
- A predictive system
- A behavioral analytics platform
- A profiling system
- A crime prediction model
- An attribution engine
- A content analysis system

---

## IV. Differentiation Clarifications

DCIT does not claim novelty in:

- Timeline aggregation
- Constraint satisfaction methodologies
- Distributed systems analysis

Its distinguishing characteristic is the structural restriction to necessary-condition reasoning and enforced epistemic boundaries.

---

## V. Audience-Specific Emphasis

### Academic Context

Emphasize:
- Formal axioms
- Determinism
- Explicit failure conditions
- Bounded claim structure

Avoid:
- Market framing
- Operational hype
- Overstated novelty

---

### Government / Public Policy Context

Emphasize:
- Post-event closure
- Expressive-content prohibition
- Case isolation
- Non-surveillance architecture

Avoid:
- Predictive language
- Risk framing
- Actor-centric descriptions

---

### Enterprise Context

Emphasize:
- Audit-grade reconstruction
- Deterministic reproducibility
- Constraint artifacts (graphs, windows, exclusions)

Avoid:
- SIEM comparisons
- SOC positioning
- Alerting language

---

## VI. Binding Effect

If DCIT is described in a manner inconsistent with this guidance, clarification SHALL be issued to restore alignment with the Canon.
