# Related Work Context

## I. Purpose

This document situates Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory (DCIT) within existing domains of digital forensics and distributed systems research.

It does not claim invention of foundational computational techniques.

---

## II. Adjacent Domains

DCIT exists within the broader ecosystem of:

- Timeline-based event reconstruction
- Digital provenance graph analysis
- Distributed systems constraint modeling
- State transition analysis

These domains predate DCIT and are acknowledged.

---

## III. Distinguishing Characteristics

DCIT distinguishes itself through:

1. Formal restriction to necessary-condition reasoning.
2. Explicit epistemic boundary excluding identity and intent.
3. Prohibition of expressive content processing.
4. Structural post-event closure requirement.
5. Enforcement-level compliance contract.

DCIT does not assert that constraint modeling is novel.
It asserts that constraint modeling under enforced epistemic limits constitutes a distinct doctrinal posture.

---

## IV. Non-Claim Statement

DCIT does not claim:

- Invention of constraint satisfaction techniques.
- Invention of distributed systems analysis.
- Invention of timeline reconstruction methods.

Its contribution lies in structural limitation, compliance formalization, and adversarial survivability.
