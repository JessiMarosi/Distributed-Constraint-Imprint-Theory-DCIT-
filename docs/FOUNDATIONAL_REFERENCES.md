## Purpose (Non-Claiming)

This file provides neutral, non-claiming references that contextualize DCIT within established academic and standards landscapes.

These references:
- Do **not** imply DCIT derives from any single work,
- Do **not** establish conceptual lineage,
- Do **not** modify DCIT doctrine.

They are provided for contextual grounding only.  
They do not imply theoretical inheritance or formal derivation.  
DCIT is presented as an independent doctrinal synthesis.
