# DCIT Failure Conditions

## I. Status

This document defines explicit invalidation conditions for Distributed Constraint Imprint Theory (DCIT).

Two categories are recognized:

1. Theory invalidation  
2. Compliance invalidation  

Failure under either category disqualifies DCIT as defined in the canonical document.

---

## II. Theory Invalidation Conditions

DCIT is invalidated if any of the following conditions are reproducibly demonstrated.

### 1. Necessary-Condition Contradiction

A necessary-condition claim of the form:

> Constraint set C requires action class A

is invalidated if a reproducible artifact set exists in which:

- Constraint set C is present, and  
- Action class A did not occur.

If reproducible, DCIT fails as a constraint-based theory.

---

### 2. Determinism Failure

Given identical:

- Artifact sets  
- Normalization rules  
- Parameters  

If constraint extraction or reconstruction outputs differ materially across executions without explicit nondeterministic mechanisms, DCIT fails as a deterministic reconstruction framework.

---

### 3. Expressive Dependence

If constraint derivation requires:

- Expressive message content  
- Speech content  
- Semantic interpretation  

DCIT fails as a system-artifact theory.

---

### 4. Probabilistic Collapse

If DCIT requires:

- Probability rankings  
- Likelihood scoring  
- Confidence scoring  
- Risk scoring  

to produce operationally meaningful outputs, it fails its necessary-condition doctrine.

---

### 5. Epistemic Boundary Violation

If DCITs claim structure expands into:

- Identity attribution  
- Intent inference  
- Behavioral classification  
- Legal or moral conclusions  

DCIT ceases to function as defined.

---

## III. Compliance Invalidation Conditions

A system is not DCIT-compliant if it exhibits any of the following.

### 1. Live Observation Capability

Support for:

- Streaming ingestion  
- Continuous telemetry  
- Real-time monitoring  

invalidates compliance.

---

### 2. Cross-Case Aggregation

Reuse of priors, baselines, or learned patterns across cases invalidates compliance.

---

### 3. Expressive Processing Capability

If the system processes:

- Message bodies  
- Speech transcripts  
- Semantic embeddings  
- Content-derived features  

it is not DCIT-compliant.

---

### 4. Actor-Directed Output

Outputs that include:

- Identity claims  
- Intent assertions  
- Guilt framing  
- Behavioral labels  

invalidate compliance.

---

### 5. Probabilistic Output Framing

Outputs that include:

- Likelihood rankings  
- Confidence scores  
- Risk scores  
- Most likely scenarios  

invalidate compliance.

---

### 6. Narrative Generation

Generation of story-form event reconstructions invalidates compliance.

---

## IV. Binding Effect

These conditions are binding for any system claiming DCIT compliance.

Failure requires reclassification and removal of the DCIT designation.
